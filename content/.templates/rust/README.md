## Installation

Before doing anything, you will want to install [the Rust compiler and toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). To build from source, you can:

1. Clone this repository to your preferred `location`.

```
git clone TODO location
```

2. Go to your installation (`cd location`), and install the executable:

```
cargo install --path .
```

This will add the `TODO` executable to your list of cargo binaries.
